    "I’m Tylor Duong, a Computer Science student at Arizona State University (Expected May 2027, 3.80 GPA) and an early graduate focused on building polished, high-impact products.",
    "My work spans full-stack development, object-oriented programming, and game development—ranging from responsive web interfaces in React/Next.js + Tailwind to Unity2D/Unity3D experiences. I enjoy shipping features end-to-end and iterating quickly based on real user needs.",
    "Recently, I’ve been building AR Fitness Coach (EPICS @ ASU), a web-based fitness app that uses computer vision for real-time form correction. I’ve also participated in hackathons and engineering events where I collaborate under time constraints, learn new tools fast, and deliver working demos.",
